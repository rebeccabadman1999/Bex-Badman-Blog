As a fashion and beauty orientated magazine, often referred to as [“the fashion bible”,](https://www.condenast.ru/en/portfolio/magazines/vogue/) Vogue has always been one step ahead of the curve, setting trends and standards as a highly respected publication for around 120 years. The task that Vogue has taken upon itself is not merely limited to reporting the new fads, phases, and fashions, they also must incorporate the changes in society by choosing brands and designers that reflect their inclusive agenda. This begs the question of whether Vogue’s timeless logo still holds its integrity, despite changes within the fashion industry. 

 

When Vogue was first published in the [1890s, the logos were hand lettered](https://1000logos.net/vogue-logo/) for every issue by an illustrator to represent the themes of the issue that was published. A similar idea was used when Conde Nast took over the magazine in the early 1900’s, where each cover logo was more colourful and theatrical, yet still personal to the issue—representing the Art Deco/ Jazz era. 

 

It was only in the 1950’s that Vogue adopted the first version of its iconic typeface; Didot. Since the 1950’s, Vogue has chosen an all-upper case, Didot typeface as their permanent logo. The font itself was named after the [brothers Firmin and Pierre](https://blog.logomyway.com/vogue-logo/) Didot, who were highly renowned printers, publishers, inventors, and typeface designers. The Vogue covers still use this typeface, or a custom version named “Vogue AG” which is very avant garde/ gothic.

This choice of typeface resonates with Vogue’s iconic status, not only due to the history of the Didot font; depicting its elegance and credibility, but also the fact that the Vogue brand remains extremely poignant. As a consumer audience, we are drawn to brands whose logos instill faith in the integrity of their brands, alligning their memorability with the notion of quality. Essentially, Vogue’s everlasting, timeless presence in the face of fashion and its evolution is partially due to the dependability of their chosen typeface. 

 

The word “[Vogue” is defined as ‘the prevailing fashion or style at a particular time’](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vogue), which gives the impression that the magazine which shares this title, will always remain current with its themes and content. 

 

The magazine embodies the essence of its name through its naturally elegant, yet gender neutral typeface, lacking in feminine flair. The gothic font depicts neither feminine or masculine tendencies which emphasises their dedication to inclusivity within their brand. Depending on the issue, the colour choice also varies in order to accentuate the choice of cover image, which supports Vogue’s bold statement in fashion content. 

 

These choices appear to represent the changes in society and the evolution of fashion, in that fashion is for everyone but we aspire to be fashionable. In a recent [article in Vogue, by Emily Chan, she highlights](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/fashion-transparency-index-2022) the fact that we need more transparency within the fashion industry and its leading brands, who must now be held acountable for the way in which they conduct their production and policies, especially regarding their approaches to the environment. 

 

The neutrality of Vogue’s typeface does not allow for the visibility of its empowered feminie body. [As stated by Nina-sophia Miralles in the Guardian,](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/mar/21/inside-vogue-where-women-have-the-top-jobs-but-men-still-rule) Vogue seems to have women in particularly crucial roles, yet are still dominated by a male presence. Therefore, despite the magazine’s appearance of inclusivity, the subtle tone of female repression is hinted at through this lack of femininity in their typeface choice. 

 

It is believable that Vogue’s typeface branding has survived the test of timee due to the sheer power that it holds over the fashion world with its inpenatrable reputation. The absence of panache or intricacy with the typeface incites an authority and sense of integrity that Vogue has held for years. It is reliable and in itself, fashionable, which entices the fashion hungry reader.
