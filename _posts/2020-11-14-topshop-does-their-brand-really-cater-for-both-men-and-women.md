After 56 years of fast fashion, Topshop is still a profiting multinational retailer who have been physically catering for both men and women since 1978. Their brand's typeface is both bold and unbiased but do they really cater for both sexes ?

Top shop was initially set out as an extension of the Peter Robinsons' store, and department of women's fashion, but later became its own youth fashion brand (ages 13-24) when its parent company, Burton divided Peter Robinson and Topshop into two separate entities.
