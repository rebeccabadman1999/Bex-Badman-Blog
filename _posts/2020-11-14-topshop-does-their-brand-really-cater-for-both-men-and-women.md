After 56 years of fast fashion, Topshop is still a profiting multinational retailer who have been physically catering for both men and women since 1978. Their brand's typeface is both bold and unbiased but do they really cater for both sexes ?

Topshop was initially set out as an extension of the Peter Robinsons' store, and department of women's fashion. But it later became its own youth fashion brand (ages 13-24) when its parent company, Burton divided Peter Robinson and Topshop into two separate entities. While in 1978, Burton decided to launch Top Man in order to cater for the extremely slow progression of mens 'High street fashion'. 

I would say that as brands go, Top shop has always been an extremely relateable brand who manage to cater for all; including their men and women's departments while recently including more vintage sections in order to cover a wide customer profile. In some respects, Topshop has the ability to transcend most social restrictions as it has both 'High end' elements as well as 'High street'.
