The Body Shop was founded in 1976 by Dame Anita Roddick, starting out as only a little green painted shop in Brighton. The idea behind this little haven of ethically sourced and natural products was to help women believe in their natural beauty, a concept which the branding of The Body Shop reflects in both typography and image.
