From **Legally Blonde** to the likes of **Clueless** and **10 Things I Hate About You**, the film industry has always had a specific stereo type in the way that it depicts our iconic "Chick Flicks". However, despite modern society calling for the reformation of our leading ladies' image-- strong and empowered, the way that the industry publicises this genre with its' particular typography, has ceased to alter and reflect this. In the words of Elle Woods herself; 

> ''whoever said orange was the new pink is seriously disturbed".

Your average "chick flick" is quite often identified by the stereotypically pink, girly colour of the titles, while the text itself is in bold capitals with spaces between the lettering. These titles are always loud and garish and make a clear statement about the nature of the films; whimsical to say the least. 

When choosing a film to watch, it is not uncommon to judge the theme, pace and integrity from the cover poster that is presented to us. Considering the sheer volume of films that are made easily accessible to us by platforms such as Netflix, it is far easier to differentiate between content that advertises itself just so. Titles such as Clueless, Mean Girls and Legally Blonde all share these definitive features such as colour, size and formation to embody the 'Rom-com' genre and adhere to the idea of an easy watch.
