From past to present relationships and pen to print, we have seen the evolution of a love letter. In an era that is dominated by digital, it is sometimes hard to accertain the real meaning behind the words that we send, but was this always the case? The adressing of an envelope and the time taken to write a hand written note seems to have far more connotations of love than the simple 'pinging' of a text; "I love you".
