Following 8 years as America's first African American First lady, Michelle Obama's Memoir-- Becoming, really highlights the way in which she became as influential as her male counterparts with its ironically bold, White Typeface. 

Throughout the years Michelle Obama has stood for many causes, both before, during and after her husband's presedential reign. Some of these include her volunteering for soup kitchens and schools as well as healthy living initiatives, not to mention her active presence in the BLAME movement.
