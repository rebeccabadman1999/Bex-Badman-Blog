Following 8 years as America's first African American First lady, Michelle Obama's Memoir-- Becoming, really highlights the way in which she became as influential as her male counterparts with its ironically bold, White Typeface. 

Throughout the years Michelle Obama has stood for many causes, both before, during and after her husband's presedential reign. Some of these include her volunteering for soup kitchens and schools as well as healthy living initiatives, not to mention her active presence in the BLAME movement. But her influence is not merely limited to her role as wife of the former president, it also extends to her ability to shine above and beyond as a powerful, independent Black woman who has inspired many with her charisma. 

Michelle's biography "Becoming" was published in 2018, a year after her final speech as First Lady. However i believe that the whole image of this book represents more than just the life of Michelle Obama, and is infact a representation of feminism, equality and humble ambition.

As referred to previously, the use of white, 'all caps' text is a key statement as it is a direct contrast to Michelle's skin tone. The irony of the colour choice is in the way that it belittles the white patriarchy in America; for instance Trump. But is also a demonstration of her power, defiance and feminist attitudes, in particular reference to Black women. As the FIRST African American first lady, Michelle calls out to all women as a beacon of hope but especially to communities who have been penalised, unjustifiably, for their race.
