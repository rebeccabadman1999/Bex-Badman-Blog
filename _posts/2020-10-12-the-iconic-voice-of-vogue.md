*With Vogue's ever growing, ever changing community, how can they afford to keep a logo which has been used for decades?* 

As a fashion and beauty orientated magazine, often referred to as "the fashion bible", Vogue has always been one step ahead of the trends and a highly respected publication. With this in mind, the task that Vogue has been set as an iconic fashion magazine does not merely relate to reporting the new fads, phases and fashions. They also have to incorporate the changes in society by choosing brands and designers that reflect this, in every issue. Hence forth, this called into question their logo which has withstood the test of time, despite the changes in the industry which vogue showcases.

 When Vogue was first published in the 1890s, the logos were hand lettered for every issue by an illustrator so as to represent the themes of the issue that was published. A similar idea was used when Conde Nast took over the magazine in the early 1900's, where each cover logo was more colourful and theatrical yet still personal to the issue-- this represented the Art Deco/ Jazz age. It was only in the 1940's that Vogue adopted the first version of its iconic typeface; Didot. However they were still deliberating between the use of Serif to Sans Serif. Since the 1950's, Vogue has chosen an all upper case, Didot typeface as their permanent logo. The font itself was named for the brothers Pierre and Firmin Dido who were highly regarded publishers, printers and typeface designers, and the current covers still use this type face or a custom version named "Vogue AG" which is very avant garde/ gothic.
