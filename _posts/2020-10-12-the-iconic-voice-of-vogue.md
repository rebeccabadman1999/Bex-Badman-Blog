*With Vogue's ever growing, ever changing community, how can they afford to keep a logo which has been used for decades?* 

As a fashion and beauty orientated magazine, often referred to as "the fashion bible", Vogue has always been one step ahead of the trends and a highly respected publication. With this in mind, the task that Vogue has been set as an iconic fashion magazine does not merely relate to reporting the new fads, phases and fashions. They also have to incorporate the changes in society by choosing brands and designers that reflect this, in every issue. Hence forth, this called into question their logo which has withstood the test of time, despite the changes in the industry which vogue showcases.

When Vogue was first published in the 1890s, the logos were hand lettered for every issue by an illustrator so as to represent the issue that was published.
