*With Vogue's ever growing, ever changing community, how can they afford to keep a logo which has been used for decades?* 

As a fashion and beauty orientated magazine, often referred to as "the fashion bible", Vogue has always been one step ahead of the trends as well as highly respected. The task that Vogue has been set, as an iconic fashion magazine does not merely relate to reporting the new fads, phases and fashions. They also have to incorporate the changes in society by choosing brands and designers that reflect this, in every issue.
