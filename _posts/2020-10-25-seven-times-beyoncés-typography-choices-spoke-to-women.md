Beyoncé has always used powerful imagery to convey her strong feminist, cultural messages. Having recently released her Netflix documentary 'Mrs. Carter's cultural evolution aka "Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé', she is no stranger to using the art of typography to engage an audience and create a powerful feminist movement- for women alike. 

To demonstrate some of Queen Bey's sassy, empowered flare, i turned to her discography and the way that she uses the style of her album covers to speak to the crowds:

In 2003, Bey's debut album following the disbanding of Destiny's child, Dangerously in Love was the first album that she released. The album cover had a particularly naughties feel with its digital graffics; a hint towards the turning of the century.

The choice of font resembles Churchward Design font by BluHead studio, it is a cartoon like font which could be seen as a very youthful, fun choice. In 2003, Beyonce at 22 would have been in her own roaring 20s, therefore the choice of font embraced her girlish charm but also her transition into being a woman. To all of the young girls who adored Bey at the time, the text appealed to both a young audience who admired her, while their older counter parts enjoyed the vibrance and energy that this album incited.

Her second, third and fourth albums, which ironically the fourth was named '4', were defined by their much more elaborate typefaces.
