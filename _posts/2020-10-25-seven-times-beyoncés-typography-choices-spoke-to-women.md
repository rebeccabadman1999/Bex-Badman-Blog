Beyoncé has always used powerful imagery to convey her strong feminist, cultural messages. Having recently released her Netflix documentary 'Mrs. Carter's cultural evolution aka "Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé', she is no stranger to using the art of typography to engage an audience and create a powerful movement- for women alike.
