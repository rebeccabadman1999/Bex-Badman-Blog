<div class="facts">
		<p class="me"> If i had to pick one interesting fact to tell you about myself, it would probably be that my family live in the city where Hot Fuzz was filmed; a little place called Wells. I was born in Bristol but moved here with my mum and brother when i was 17, it's not grand but it is my favourite place to be.
		I am currently a student at Oxford Brookes University, studying Publishing, media and Journalism which suits me down to the ground.I hope that this page will allow you to get to know me a little more and why I have chosen to write about feminism in Typography. </p>

	<h2 class="interests_header">My interests</h2>

	<p class="me_2"> I have always been a creative person, and even though I did persue a maths A Level, I would always return to something that would involve creating. This little pastiche was a quick sketch of myself reading in South Park, Oxford. Not only is creating content something that i wish to pursue as a career, but it has also been an outlet and a source of relaxation for me over the years. </p>

<h1 class="what_header"> What have I done?</h1>
<p class="exist"> The past year has been one of the most eventful in my life so far, predominantly with Covid 19. In the summer I began an online news website with others on my course called <a class="exist_link" href="https://existnewsmedia.wordpress.com/home/" target="blank"> Exist.</a> This website was the first time that i could publish articles and my voice in a place that had a chance to be heard and it has inspired me since! I am now signing up to work for The TabBrookes and b&together charity, which focuses on mental health for university students. A topic which is close to my heart. </p>
